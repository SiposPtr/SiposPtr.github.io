  <h1> My passion </h1>
  My passion is karate. I started it about 12 years ago.
  I did Shotokan karate style for several years and i reached the 3rd kyu which means I have a brown belt.
  I started Goju-kai two years ago. My coach allowed me to do 11 exams at once to get the brown belt. I had to do every single exam from the white belt on the same day so i'm a bit proud of myself.
