How did this site born?.
I was **really** bored at the summer of 2018 so I searched on the internet to do some cool stuff.
I always do that but then I delete the project and forget about it. I thought that this summer should be unique.
Then I got an idea that I should ask one of my teacher what should I do.
He offered me to do a webpage with GitHub Pages because he was playing with this before.
I managed to do it.
And thats it. :D
