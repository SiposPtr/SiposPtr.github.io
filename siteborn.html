  <h1>How did this site born?.</h1>
  I was <b>really</b> bored at the summer of 2018 so I searched on the internet to do some cool stuff.
  I always do that but then I delete the project and forget about it. I thought that this summer should be unique.
  Then I got an idea that I should ask one of my teacher what should I do.
  He offered me to do a webpage with GitHub Pages because he was playing with this before.
  I managed to do it.
  And thats it. :D
