## Welcome
The site is under development.
I am trying to make it look like a normal site.


### About me
I am an 18 years old Hungarian boy who loves IT and programming.
I learn IT at school.

### Me & IT
My father works to an IT company so I was at a very technical environment from my childhood.
It was obvious for me to choose this as my job&hobby.
Now in high school I finally can study what i love.
And this is **really** important.
I love playing with the IOS software.
I sometimes i do some programming. I built several applications just for my own happiness but none of them were a big thing.
The other part of IOS software that I love is the hacking.
It's too difficult for me but sometimes I play with it.


### My passion
My passion is karate. I started it about 12 years ago.
I did Shotokan karate style for several years and i reached the 3rd kyu which means I have a brown belt.
I started Goju-kai two years ago. My coach allowed me to do 11 exams at once to get the brown belt. I had to do every single exam from the white belt on the same day so i'm a bit proud of myself.

### How did this site born?.
I was **really** bored at the summer of 2018 so I searched on the internet to do some cool stuff.
I always do that but then I delete the project and forget about it. I thought that this summer should be unique.
Then I got an idea that I should ask one of my teacher what should I do.
He offered me to do a webpage with GitHub Pages because he was playing with this before.
I managed to do it.
And thats it. :D

### About this site
I don't really know what will I post or upload to this site.
After September maybe I will have some projects about Git Pages so then I will manage the site.
