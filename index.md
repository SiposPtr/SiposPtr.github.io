## Welcome
The site is under development.
I am trying to make it look like a normal site.

### About me
I am an 18 years old Hungarian boy who loves IT a programming. :computer:
My passion is karate. I started it about 12 years ago.
I did Shotokan karate style for several years and i reached the 3rd kyu which means i have a brown belt.
I started Goju-kai two years ago. My coach allowed me to do 11 exams at once to get the brown belt. I had to do every single exam from the white belt on the same day.
Which means soon(in this case:3-4-5years) i could get the black belt in both styles.
Personally I think i will only do the black belt in the Goju-kai style.
But it's the future. :)

### How did this site born?.
I was **really** bored at the summer of 2018 so I searched on the internet to do some cool stuff.
I always do that but then I delete the project and forget about it. I thought that this summer should be unique.
Then i got an idea that I should ask one of my teacher what should I do.
He offered me to do a webpage with GitHub Pages and I managed to do it.
I don't know what to do with this yet but maybe after September I will upload things.
