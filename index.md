## Welcome
The site is under development.
I am trying to make it look like a normal site.

### About me
I am an 18 years old Hungarian boy who loves IT a programming.

### About this site
I was **really** bored at the summer of 2018 so I searched on the internet to do some cool stuff.
I always do that but then I delete the project and forget about it. I thought that this summer should be unique.
Then i got an idea that I should ask one of my teacher what should I do.
He offered me to do a webpage with GitHub Pages and I managed to do it.
I don't know what to do with this yet but maybe after September I will upload things.
