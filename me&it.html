  My father works to an IT company so I was at a very technical environment from my childhood. It was obvious for me to choose this as my job&hobby. Now in high school I finally can study what i love. And this is really important. I love playing with the IOS software. I sometimes I do some programming. I built several applications just for my own happiness but none of them were a big thing. The other part of IOS software that I love is the hacking. Itâ€™s too difficult for me but sometimes I play with it.
